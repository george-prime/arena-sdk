// A checkpoint: where the player says the world was, at a tick both sides
// named beforehand.
//
// WHAT IT BUYS. A transcript already replays: hand the batches to `step` and
// the digest comes out the same, and a flipped bit breaks the chain. What it
// cannot do is say WHERE two runs part company - the answer is "somewhere in
// ninety seconds". A checkpoint is a state hash at roughly one per second, so
// a disagreement is located to a second instead of a round.
//
// AND IT IS THE EQUIVOCATION DETECTOR. Section 13B forfeits a player who
// publishes two different checkpoints for the same tick. That rule needs the
// checkpoint to be an addressable object with a key, which is exactly what
// `(round, entry, tick)` is - so the rule lives in a primary key rather than
// in a check a caller can forget.
//
// THE ENTRY NAMES THE PLAYER. The spec's shape (section 10) carries
// `player_pubkey`; this carries `entryId`, which is the tagged hash OF the
// entry contract, and that contract carries the player's key. One field
// instead of two that could disagree, and it is the key the node already
// stores rounds, ticks and batches under.
//
// THE SIGNATURE SITS BESIDE IT, NOT INSIDE IT. Section 10 lists
// `session_signature` as a field of the checkpoint; carrying it that way
// would put it inside `checkpointId`, and then the id of a mark would change
// the moment it was signed - so `previousHash` would have to name the signed
// id and the chain would shift underneath. Beside it, the id is the same
// whether or not the mark is signed, the chain rule stands, and the record
// stays fixed-size.
//
// What is signed is the tagged id, not the raw encoding: every other object
// in this protocol is committed to through its tagged hash, and keeping that
// means a checkpoint signature can never be replayed as a signature over
// some other object that happens to encode to the same bytes.
//
// The player signs, with the SESSION key - ephemeral, one per run, certified
// by the entry key inside the Entry Contract, so the long-term key is used
// once per entry and never per checkpoint. The verifier is `sessionPubkey`,
// already a field of that contract.
//
// The algorithm and the verifying live in the node. This package stays free
// of crypto dependencies for the same reason `hash.js` takes sha256 from the
// core rather than a library: a thing that pins money should not gain a
// dependency whose version could change its answer.
//
// The state hash comes from the CLIENT. `packages/nextblock`'s `hash(st)` produces
// it, and nothing in the node's `src/` imports the core - the node stores
// bytes it cannot recompute, which is what keeps the daemon a store rather
// than a second simulator.

 * IS THIS A PROOF THAT THE PLAYER SIGNED TWO WORLDS AT ONE TICK?

 * (round_id, player_pubkey, tick), or two chains that diverge at any tick,
 * forfeits the entry... The two conflicting signed checkpoints are a complete,
 * portable proof; no replay is needed."
 *
 * PORTABLE is the word that matters. This takes the two signed records and the
 * session key the entry named, and answers from those alone - no node is
 * asked, no transcript is replayed, and nothing about a committee is needed.
 * Whoever holds the two records can check them, which is what makes 13B's
 * "nodes MUST publish such a proof" worth anything.
 *
 * TWO SHAPES, both from the two records alone. Two marks at one tick
 * contradict each other; two marks naming one parent are two chains, because
 * a chain has one child per parent. 13B calls both "two chains that diverge",
 * and a proof that needed a third record would not be portable.
 *
 * `verify` is injected, as everywhere else here: this package carries no curve.
 * It may answer a promise, so this does too.
