 * over with something after it is not a transaction anybody agreed on - so it
 * cannot be pointed at the middle of a block. This walks the same structure to
 * find the span, and the span is then handed back to `parseTransaction`, which
 * re-reads it under that exact rule. A span computed wrongly does not slip
 * through: the slice fails to parse, or its txid is wrong and the block's own
 * merkle root refuses it in `chainViewOf`.
