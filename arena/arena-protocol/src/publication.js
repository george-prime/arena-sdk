// A ROUND EXISTS ONLY ONCE ITS HASH IS ON BITCOIN, BELOW ITS BEACON BLOCK.

// Section 5A.5 (v4.6.2, P1): "a Round Contract exists only once its hash is in
// a Bitcoin block before the beacon block."
//
//     publication_txid   a transaction carrying
//                        OP_RETURN "ARN" ROUND H(RoundContract)   (36 bytes)
//                        confirmed at a height strictly below the beacon block
//
// THE HOLE IT CLOSES. 4.6.1 ordered a contract against its beacon by timestamp
// receipts, which were free: a creator published a thousand candidate rounds,
// waited for the beacon, and promoted the one whose committee was his. On chain
// every candidate costs a transaction, and the ordering is objective - the
// beacon block's hash did not exist when the publication confirmed.
//
// WHY THE TXID IS NOT IN THE CONTRACT although section 6 lists it: the
// transaction carries H(RoundContract), which is the round id, so a contract
// holding that transaction's id has no fixed point. It rides beside the
// contract, as `round_id` and `creator_signature` do.
//
// THE KIND BYTE IS OURS. The spec writes `ROUND` and fixes no value for it; it
// is 0x52, 'R', in keeping with the ASCII "ARN". A vote (27A.7.3) is "ARN" 'V'
// (ballot.js, 2026-10-13), 77 bytes: the kind byte keeps them apart.
