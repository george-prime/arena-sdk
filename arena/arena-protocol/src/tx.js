// So the txid is COMPUTED here, never accepted. It is the double hash of the

//
// NOTHING HERE IS BITCOIN CONSENSUS. No script is executed, no signature is
// checked, no amount is summed. It parses a serialization and answers two
// questions: what is this transaction called, and what does it commit to.
