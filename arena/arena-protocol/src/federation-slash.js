// §23A.3 and §23A.5, as rules a caller can run rather than paragraphs somebody has to remember. Three
// numbers live here and each has a way of being got wrong that this file exists to refuse:
//
//   the exposure cap      is (f + 1) x the SMALLEST seated bond, not the sum of the bonds. `f + 1` gone
//                         is the smallest set that halts the federation, and their bonds are what a
//                         liquidation pays players from - so the reserve may never exceed what the
//                         cheapest possible set of leavers forfeits. Summing all ten would let a
//                         federation hold cover it can only produce if EVERY guardian is slashed.
//   a slashed bond        never goes straight to anybody: it waits in the federation's liquidation
//                         escrow under the arbitration keys, and spends only when the federation is
//                         CLOSED (nothing was lost: 75% census nodes, 25% developers) or HALTED. On a
//                         HALT the ORDER is the whole of it - every unspent note is paid at face value
//                         FIRST, and only what no player claimed is split 75/25. The people who run the
//                         network are never paid out of money a player could still have claimed.
//   the abandonment proof needs `2f + 1` attestations normally, and on a halt cannot have them: the
//                         federation no longer has that many guardians. Then it is whoever is left,
//                         plus the halt itself, which anyone can see.
