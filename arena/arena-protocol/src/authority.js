// 27A.4: WHICH DONATION SET IS THE NETWORK'S, FROM WHEN, AND WHO SAID SO.
//
// `donation.js` answers a different question and answers it well: given a list
// of payees and shares, does it stand, and what is each owed. It cannot answer
// this one. A list that stands is a list ANYBODY can write - the bytes are
// checked against their own shares and against nothing else - so before this
// file a thief and the network's own operator published objects that were
// indistinguishable.
//
// The section gives the object:
//
//     DonationSet {
//       network_id
//       serial          monotonic; the highest validly signed one wins
//       entries[]       lnurl + share_bps, summing to 10000
//       valid_from      block height
//       signature       by donation_authority_pubkey
//     }
//
// Four of those five fields had no code. What each one is for, in the order
// they stop a different failure:
//
//   network_id   27A.9: "the trust anchor is the client's own built-in
//                network_id, NEVER A VALUE FROM THE CONTRACT". A set for
//                another network is somebody else's payees, and forking the
//                code to write your own address in "has not captured the
//                donations - you have left".
//   serial       Two sets and no order is two nodes paying different people.
//                The highest validly signed one wins, and an older one
//                published later changes nothing - that is what "cannot be
//                rolled back" means when the publication is on a chain that
//                anybody can add to.
//   valid_from   A set with no start applies from whenever each node happened
//                to see it, which is not a time two nodes can agree on.
//   signature    The whole point. One key signs this object and nothing else
//                in the protocol.
//
// AND THE ROTATION, which is the half that is easy to leave for later and must
// not be. 27A.4's own row: authority stolen, "the thief signs a set with a
// higher serial pointing at their own LNURLs" - and the remedy is a rotation
// from the cold key, "no fork, the census survives". A revocation path nobody
// has exercised is a revocation path that does not work, so the rotation here
// is not a field: it is checked, it is ordered, and from its `valid_from` the
// old key's sets are refused whatever serial they carry.
//
// WHAT THE KEYS CANNOT DO is not enforced here because it cannot be reached
// from here: 27A.4's exhaustive list - no pause, no fee, no threshold, no
// node, no round, no result, no player's money - is a statement about which
// objects carry an authority signature, and this file is the only one that
// checks for one. Nothing else in the protocol reads these keys, and that is
// the enforcement.
//
// NO CURVE, like every other file in this package: `verify` is injected, and
// the caller one package over brings the real BIP-340. NO MONEY: nothing here
// pays an LNURL, and what a donation costs a player is 6e's letter, not this
// one.

 * "no set is in force" and "I threw them all away" are different facts, and
 * only one of them is a bug.
 *
 * A ROTATION BLANKS THE LIST, and that is 27A.4's own reading rather than a
 * strictness of taste: "from `valid_from`, sets signed by the old authority
 * are rejected". Every set the old key signed dies with it, including the
 * honest ones it signed before the theft - so between a rotation and the new
 * authority's first publication this network has no set in force and pays
 * nobody.
 *
 * The alternative was measured and is worse: grandfathering what the old key
 * published before the rotation keeps the THIEF'S set alive too, because the
 * thief published before the rotation as well. A revocation that leaves the
 * stolen list in force is not a revocation.
 *
 * NO SET IN FORCE IS NOT AN ERROR. A network can run without one and 22A's
 * player donating nothing is unaffected: `splitDonation` already answers a
 * zero donation without judging a set at all. What must never happen is a set
 * being IN FORCE without a signature to point at, and that is what this
