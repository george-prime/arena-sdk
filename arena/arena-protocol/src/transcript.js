// A round's transcript: the object a node hands over and a verifier replays.
//
// §11 chains the batches and §13C says the canonical transcript is what every
// node replays, so it has to be ONE thing with ONE hash - not a table a
// verifier queries and hopes it asked for everything. This is that thing:
// the round, the entry, and the batches in chain order.
//
// AND THE CHECKPOINT CHAIN, which §13C names FIRST: the canonical transcript
// is "the longest checkpoint chain that carries receipts from at least 5
// committee nodes, TOGETHER WITH the input batches whose hashes it commits
// to". For a while this object carried the second half only, and the cost was
// measured rather than argued: three nodes carrying three different mark
// chains over one set of batches - two marks against three, and a third node
// whose player committed to a DIFFERENT world at the last tick - all produced
// one `transcriptHash`, and therefore one `resultId` for the committee to
// sign. The thing a result pins has to be the thing that is replayed, and
// what a replay is checked against is the state the player signed.
//
// THE MARKS ARE CARRIED SIGNED, and the hash covers the signature. That is
// the opposite of the rule one object down - a checkpoint's own id is taken
// before it is signed, so the chain does not shift underneath it - and the
// reason is that this is a container, not an identity. What must be pinned
// here is exactly the bytes a node hands over and a committee signs a result
// about; a signature outside the hash would let a node serve marks with
// nobody's signature on them and still match the hash the result named.
//
// WHOSE signature it is stays the caller's business, as everywhere in this
// package: there is no curve here, so `checkTranscript` checks the chain, the
// ticks and what the marks commit to, and the session key that verifies them
// lives in the entry contract.
//
// A transcript with NO marks is still a transcript - it is what a node hands
// a client back on resume, where the marks travel on their own endpoint and
// are checked there against receipts. It is not the canonical object, and the
// difference shows in the hash rather than being a matter of who is asking.

 * WHAT THE MARKS ARE CHECKED AGAINST IS THIS OBJECT AND NOTHING ELSE. Every
 * mark's `inputChainHash` has to be a head this transcript actually reaches -
 * §11's "a transcript whose inputs were never published cannot be replayed"
 * turned from a sentence into a refusal - and the heads may not go backwards,
 * because a later mark on an earlier input head is a rewind and not a chain.
 * The last mark's head must be the LAST batch: inputs past the last carried
 * mark are inputs no committee stood behind, and a transcript that carried
 * them would hand a replay ticks nobody receipted.

/**
 * DOES THIS TRANSCRIPT BELONG TO THAT ENTRY, AND DID IT BEGIN WHERE THE ENTRY
 * SAYS IT JOINED?
 *
 * 0.8: "Late join is a normal feature, not merely reconnect. Each accepted
 * entrant receives the same contract-defined mission duration `T_run`, even
 * when wall-clock start times differ." Section 7: "Late joins simply add more
 * Entry Contracts. The Round Contract is never rewritten."
 *
 * So a late entrant's world does not begin at tick 0 - it begins at the tick
 * their own Entry Contract names, and `joinTick` is the field that says which.
 * Measured before this existed: an entry that joined at tick 50 had its
 * transcript ACCEPTED beginning at 0, at 50 and at 500, all three, because
 * `checkTranscript` is handed a transcript and never the entry it is for. A
 * player could publish a run that started earlier than they joined, or one
 * that skipped the first four hundred ticks, and every check passed.
 *
 * The entry is signed and the tick is in it, so this is the same discipline as
 * everywhere else here: the thing being checked is bound to the thing that was
 * signed, and whoever brings the transcript does not also get to choose what
 * it is checked against.
 *
 * WHAT THIS CANNOT SAY is how LONG the run may be. 0.8's "same contract-defined
 * mission duration T_run" needs `player_run_duration`, which section 6 names
 * and this Round Contract does not carry - one of the eighteen absent names
 * audited during item 16, parked because adding one moves every round id. It
 * is reported as unchecked rather than assumed.
