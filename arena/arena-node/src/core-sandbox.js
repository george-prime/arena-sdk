// THE SANDBOX A GAME'S CORE RUNS IN, AND THE ONLY WAY THIS NODE RUNS ONE (spec §0A.6).
//
// "It runs it only in the replay worker: no network, no file system, no clock, no randomness but the round's seed, the
// same integers on every machine." Before this a core was imported like any module of the node - in the replay worker,
// in the daemon's own thread (the registrations main.js loads, the packages plugin-package.js installs) and under the warm
// ghost - with every right the process has. Now every one of those loads comes here:
//
// 1. FILES, READ BY THE NODE. The node reads the core's files itself and checks them against the core's hash before a
//    line of it runs: a tree (every .js under `root`) or one file (sha256 of its bytes), by core-hash.js - the rule an app
//    takes from arena-sdk/core-hash (kanban #691). The core gets source text only; it never opens a file.
// 2. AN EMPTY CONTEXT. A fresh vm context with a global of its own (no node object behind it), code generation off (no eval, no Function, no
//    wasm). Before the core is evaluated its own intrinsics lose Date, Math.random, Intl, WebAssembly, SharedArrayBuffer,
//    Atomics, eval, Function, WeakRef, FinalizationRegistry and V8's own console; fetch, process, require, Buffer, timers,
//    performance and crypto are never there - a vm context does not have the node's globals.
// 3. THE LINKER IS THE GATE. Its modules are linked as vm.SourceTextModule (the core thread is started with --experimental-vm-modules; the node needs no flag): a relative
//    import resolves inside the hashed file set and nowhere else; node:*, package names, absolute paths and URLs are
//    refused, and with no importModuleDynamically an import() throws.
// 4. ONLY STRINGS CROSS. core-driver.js runs beside the core in the same sandbox and is called with an operation's name
//    and a JSON string; it answers a JSON string. No object of the node's is ever handed in.
// 5. A THREAD OF ITS OWN, WATCHED. The sandbox is built in a worker thread per core (core-host.js), a V8 isolate of its own
//    that holds none of the node's memory; the node calls it synchronously and waits for each answer against a deadline
//    (Atomics.wait). Each core thread is started by this node thread's core supervisor (core-supervisor.js), a thread that is
//    never blocked: it hears the core thread's exit at once - a heap death wakes the node, not its deadline - and reads the
//    process's memory every 2 ms while a call runs, ending the core before the backstop. No vm timeout is used: one firing in
//    the node's own thread was measured aborting the whole process (node 24.15, "Assertion failed: (env_->execution_async_id())
//    == (0)").
